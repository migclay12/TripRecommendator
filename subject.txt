### Chapter I — A word about this Project

The goal is to develop a frontend application where users can input their desired trip location in free-text form. Using AI tools and APIs, the app will identify potential travel destinations and display them on a custom map. The design will prioritize a mobile-first approach, ensuring the app is accessible and user-friendly across all devices.

### Chapter II — Introduction

What this Project will show you:

• How to create a frontend application with a mobile-first design.
• Handling free-text input from users and processing it using AI tools and APIs.
• Integrating AI-powered tools to interpret user input and suggest relevant travel destinations.
• Displaying locations on a custom interactive map.
• Applying a minimum accessibility standard for improved user interaction.
• Ensuring user experience (UX) remains at the forefront of the application design.
• Exploring advanced features like speech-to-text, image recognition, and drawing areas on a map for enhanced input methods.

### Chapter III — General instructions

Unless explicitly specified, the following rules will apply for every project of this Piscine.

• This subject is the one and only trustable source. Don’t trust any rumor.
• This subject can be updated up to one hour before the turn-in deadline.
• A README.md documenting the project, its installation, and usage will be required during evaluation.
• The assignments in a subject must be done in the given order. Later assignments won’t be rated unless all the previous ones are perfectly executed.
• Be careful about the access rights of your files and folders.
• Your assignments WON’T be evaluated by your Piscine peers.
• You must not leave in your turn-in your workspace any file other than the ones explicitly requested by the assignments. If the assignment doesn’t specify them, put only the necessary ones to run your project.
• Using some API Key or Token? Keep them for you! Do not push them on your repository.
• You have a question? Ask your left neighbor. Otherwise, try your luck with your right neighbor.
• Every technical answer you might need is available in the man or on the Internet.
• You must read the examples thoroughly. They can reveal requirements that are not obvious in the assignment’s description.
• By Thor, by Odin! Use your brain!!!

• Docker is mandatory to submit the project. Please provide a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to run the project.

**Free-Text Input for Trip Location**

• Users will enter their desired travel location or preferences in free-text format.
• The application will process the input using AI tools and APIs to identify relevant travel destinations.

**AI and API Integration**

• The app will use AI-powered tools to interpret the user’s input and suggest potential travel locations.
• These travel destinations will be shown on a custom interactive map.

**Mobile-First Design**

• The app will be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring optimal functionality and usability on smartphones and tablets.
• Responsive design principles will ensure the app adapts well to different screen sizes.

**Accessibility Focus**

• The app will have a minimum accessibility standard, focusing on ensuring that users with different needs can interact with the app.
• While strict compliance with WCAG standards isn’t mandatory, the app should provide a basic level of accessibility.

Before starting, review the technologies referenced in the project description.
You may also explore free online options such as Leaflet.js or Gemini to help you complete this project.

Although this is mainly a frontend project, a minimal backend may be required to handle certain operations securely and interact with external services.
